1) Explain that the command line allows direct access to a computer's underlying code:
  The command line is the primary interface that is used by computer, this is also how we interact directly with the underlying code of computer.
  
2) Use simple command line commands, such as ls, touch, mkdir, rm, pwd and cd
  ls - list
  touch - creates an empty file with a given name
  mkdir - creates a new directory
  rm - removes a file (difficult to recover)
  rm -r DirectoryName - removes a directory and everything inside
       ("rm" command with two parameters - the first parameter (switch) is "-r" and tells the remove command to recursively remove all files within the directory as well as the directory itself, 
       the second parameter is the name of the directory the command will act on.)
  rmdir - removes an empty directory
  pwd - print working directory - the exact path of the directory that we're in
  cd - change directory
  
3) Use switches to enhance command abilities
  A parameter is essentially an add-on to a command to make your instructions more specific, start with the hyphen-
  
4) Manipulate files from the command line

5) Update a .profile file or an equivalent such as .bash_profile or .zshrc

6) Getting help:
man ls - The "man" or "manual" command takes a parameter of another command to provide you more information about it. 
In the example here, we want to know more about the "ls" command.
Here can find out what all of the parameters are, the description and various other pieces of information for using it correctly.
