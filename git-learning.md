1) Recall that git is a version control system (VCS)
  It's a technology used to control and track different versions of the code. It also allows multiple versions to be built simultaniously and then brought together.

2) Recognise common git commands, such as fetch, merge, clone, pull, push, add, remote, and commit

3) Explain the following terms: 'staging', 'branching', 'upstream', 'remote'
  Staging - allows you to continue making changes to the working directory and to record changes in small commits.
    To "stage" is to do git add file.ext for a specific file, or git add . to affect all modified and untracked files.
    Files that have been added in this way are said to be "staged" and they will be included in the next "commit".
    The commit is a snapshot of your work created e.g. with git commit -m "I wrote something"
  
  Branching - 
    
  Upstream -
    
  Remote - 
4) Explain how repos work, referencing the .git file

5) Explain how git branching works

6) Fork a git repo

7) Clone a git repo
  git clone creates a folder with a github repo in it.

8) Add files for staging in a git repo
  git add

9) Commit staged files in a git repo
git commit -m - also adds a message to the commit

10) Create a new topic branch locally

11) Push files to a remote repo
  git push -u origin master

12) Make a pull request to an upstream repo
